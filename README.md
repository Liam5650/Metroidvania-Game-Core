Metroidvania Game Core is a game framework that provides a straightforward and comprehensive way to create Metroidvania-style games in Unity. A web demo is currently [accessible on itch.io](https://liam5650.itch.io/metroidvania-demo) and highlights many of the framework's features. This readme will be updated shortly with documentation on how to use the framework and create your own Metroidvania game (current target is before the end of August, 2024) .
