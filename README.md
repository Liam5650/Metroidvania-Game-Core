Metroidvania Game Core is a comprehensive game framework designed to provide an accessible way to create Metroidvania-style games in Unity. A web demo is [available on itch.io](https://liam5650.itch.io/metroidvania-demo) and highlights many of the framework's key features. 

## Features

This framework features a variety of essential Metroidvania gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to build complex maps with interconnected rooms and seamless transitions, ability-based progression to create more dynamic, non-linear gameplay, as well as a robust save system that tracks detailed game states and manages event triggers like boss battles. All features have been designed with ease-of-use in mind, making it quick and straightforward to effectively use the framework.

## Installation

Simply click on the green "Code" button at the top-right of the project's main page, and select "Download ZIP". Unzip the file, open Unity Hub and click "Add", then navigate to and select the project folder. If you are prompted that the project was made using a different version of Unity, you can download editor version 2021.3.14.f1 to ensure compatibility. Later editor versions are likely to work without issue as well, but have not been tested.
